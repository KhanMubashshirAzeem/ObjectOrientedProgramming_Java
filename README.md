# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Java ðŸš€

I've organized my exploration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java into distinct packages for each concept to enhance understanding. Each package focuses on a specific OOP principle, and I've added comments throughout the code to ensure clarity and ease of learning. Here's what I've covered so far:

### ðŸ“š Topics Completed

#### Abstract
- **Abstract Method**: Understanding the role of abstract methods in defining a method without implementation, to be overridden in subclasses.
- **Abstract Class**: Exploring the concept of abstract classes, which cannot be instantiated and often contain abstract methods.

#### Access Modifiers

- **Public Modifier (Access: Everywhere)**: Allows classes, methods, and variables to be accessed from any other class.
- **Private Modifier (Access: Within Class)**: Restricts access to the class itself, ensuring that only the class can access its methods and variables.
- **Protected Modifier (Access: Package & Subclasses)**: Allows access to methods and variables by classes in the same package or subclasses.
- **Default Access Modifier (Access: Package)**: Grants access to methods and variables only within the same package.

Each concept is neatly packaged and documented to make it easier to grasp and apply. ðŸ“¦ðŸ’¡
