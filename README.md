# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Java ðŸš€

I've organized my exploration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java into distinct packages for each concept to enhance understanding. Each package focuses on a specific OOP principle, and I've added comments throughout the code to ensure clarity and ease of learning. Here's what I've covered so far:

### ðŸ“š Topics Completed

#### Abstract
- **Abstract Method**: Understanding the role of abstract methods in defining a method without implementation, to be overridden in subclasses.
- **Abstract Class**: Exploring the concept of abstract classes, which cannot be instantiated and often contain abstract methods.

#### Access Modifiers

- **Public Modifier (Access: Everywhere)**: Allows classes, methods, and variables to be accessed from any other class.
- **Private Modifier (Access: Within Class)**: Restricts access to the class itself, ensuring that only the class can access its methods and variables.
- **Protected Modifier (Access: Package & Subclasses)**: Allows access to methods and variables by classes in the same package or subclasses.
- **Default Access Modifier (Access: Package)**: Grants access to methods and variables only within the same package.

#### Interface
- **Interface**: Interfaces define a contract for what a class can do without specifying how it does it. They are a key part of Javaâ€™s multiple inheritance solution, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces. This is powerful for designing systems that are modular and decoupled.

#### Encapsulation
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation ensures that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. Itâ€™s implemented by declaring class variables as private and providing public getter and setter methods. This design principle helps maintain control over the data and reduces the risk of unintended interference.

#### Inheritance
- **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a fundamental concept where one class (the child or subclass) acquires the properties and behaviors (methods and fields) of another class (the parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy among classes.

### Types of Inheritance
1. **Single Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from one superclass.
2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A class inherits from more than one class. (Note: Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance with classes, but it does with interfaces.)
3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class is derived from a class, which is also derived from another class.
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from a single superclass.
5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of more than one type of inheritance (Java achieves this through interfaces).

These concepts are neatly packaged and documented to make it easier to grasp and apply. ðŸ“¦ðŸ’¡
