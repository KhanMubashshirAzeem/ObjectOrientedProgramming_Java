I've organized my exploration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java into distinct packages for each concept to enhance understanding. Each package focuses on a specific OOP principle, with comments throughout the code to ensure clarity and ease of learning. Here's what I've covered so far:

### ðŸ“š Topics Completed

#### 1. Abstraction
- **Abstract Method**: Defines a method without implementation, to be overridden in subclasses.
- **Abstract Class**: Explores abstract classes, which cannot be instantiated and often contain abstract methods.

#### 2. Encapsulation
- **Encapsulation**: Ensures that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. Itâ€™s implemented by declaring class variables as private and providing public getter and setter methods. This helps maintain control over the data and reduces the risk of unintended interference.

#### 3. Inheritance
- **Inheritance**: A subclass acquires properties and behaviors from a superclass, promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchy among classes.

- **Types of Inheritance**:
  1. **Single Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from one superclass.
  2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A class inherits from more than one class (achievable through interfaces in Java).
  3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class is derived from a class that is itself derived from another class.
  4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from a single superclass.
  5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of multiple inheritance types (achieved through interfaces in Java).

#### 4. Polymorphism
- **Polymorphism**: Allows one interface to be used for different data types, mainly through method overloading or method overriding.

  - **Method Overloading**: Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.
    - **Types of Method Overloading**:
      1. **Changing the Number of Parameters**: Methods with the same name differ in the number of parameters.
      2. **Changing Data Types of the Arguments**: Methods with the same name and parameter count but different data types.
      3. **Changing the Order of the Parameters**: Methods with the same name and parameter count but different order of the parameters.

- **Method Overriding**: Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass, allowing the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the inherited method.

#### 5. Access Modifiers

- **Public Modifier (Access: Everywhere)**: Allows classes, methods, and variables to be accessed from any other class.
- **Private Modifier (Access: Within Class)**: Restricts access to the class itself, ensuring that only the class can access its methods and variables.
- **Protected Modifier (Access: Package & Subclasses)**: Allows access to methods and variables by classes in the same package or subclasses.
- **Default Access Modifier (Access: Package)**: Grants access to methods and variables only within the same package.

#### Rules for Java Method Overriding

1. **Overriding and Access Modifiers**  
   The overriding method cannot reduce the visibility of the inherited method (e.g., from `public` to `protected`).

2. **Final Methods Cannot Be Overridden**  
   Methods declared as `final` cannot be overridden by subclasses.

3. **Static Methods Cannot Be Overridden (Method Overriding vs Method Hiding)**  
   Static methods are not overridden; they are hidden when redefined in a subclass.

4. **Private Methods Cannot Be Overridden**  
   Private methods are not visible to subclasses, so they cannot be overridden.

5. **The Overriding Method Must Have the Same Return Type (or Subtype)**  
   The return type of the overriding method must match or be a subtype of the overridden methodâ€™s return type.

6. **Invoking Overridden Method from Subclass**  
   You can use `super.methodName()` within the subclass to call the superclassâ€™s overridden method.

These concepts are neatly packaged and documented to make it easier to grasp and apply. ðŸ“¦ðŸ’¡
