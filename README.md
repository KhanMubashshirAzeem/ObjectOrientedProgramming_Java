# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Java ðŸš€

I've organized my exploration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java into distinct packages for each concept to enhance understanding. Each package focuses on a specific OOP principle, and I've added comments throughout the code to ensure clarity and ease of learning. Here's what I've covered so far:

### ðŸ“š Topics Completed

#### Abstract
- **Abstract Method**: Understanding the role of abstract methods in defining a method without implementation, to be overridden in subclasses.
- **Abstract Class**: Exploring the concept of abstract classes, which cannot be instantiated and often contain abstract methods.

#### Access Modifiers

- **Public Modifier (Access: Everywhere)**: Allows classes, methods, and variables to be accessed from any other class.
- **Private Modifier (Access: Within Class)**: Restricts access to the class itself, ensuring that only the class can access its methods and variables.
- **Protected Modifier (Access: Package & Subclasses)**: Allows access to methods and variables by classes in the same package or subclasses.
- **Default Access Modifier (Access: Package)**: Grants access to methods and variables only within the same package.

#### Interface
- **Interface**: Interfaces define a contract for what a class can do without specifying how it does it. They are a key part of Javaâ€™s multiple inheritance solution, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces. This is powerful for designing systems that are modular and decoupled.

#### Encapsulation
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation ensures that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. Itâ€™s implemented by declaring class variables as private and providing public getter and setter methods. This design principle helps maintain control over the data and reduces the risk of unintended interference.

These concepts are neatly packaged and documented to make it easier to grasp and apply. ðŸ“¦ðŸ’¡
