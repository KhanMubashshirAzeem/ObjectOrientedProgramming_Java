Main.java class is one class to understand the concept of Encapsulation.



Person class is used for users detail and its so we used getter and setter to access that data.

PersonError in this class we have seen that we can set the data like we set in public access modifier.

PersonOutput in this class we have seen that we can set and get private data only using getter and setter method.
